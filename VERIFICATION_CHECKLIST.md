## 🔌 WebSocket Connection Verification

### Manager Initialization
```typescript
// ✓ Singleton pattern
const manager = DerivWebSocketManager.getInstance()
const manager2 = DerivWebSocketManager.getInstance()
console.assert(manager === manager2, "Singleton works!")
```

### Connection Methods Available
- [x] `connect()` - Establishes WebSocket connection
- [x] `disconnect()` - Gracefully closes connection
- [x] `isConnected()` - Returns boolean connection status
- [x] `send(message)` - Sends message to API
- [x] `subscribe(event, handler)` - Registers event listener
- [x] `unsubscribe(subscriptionId)` - Removes listener
- [x] `subscribeTicks(symbol, callback)` - Subscribes to price ticks
- [x] `getActiveSymbols()` - Fetches available symbols
- [x] `getConnectionLogs()` - Returns connection history
- [x] `onConnectionStatus(callback)` - Listens to connection state

### Error Handling Features
- [x] Connection timeout: 10 seconds
- [x] Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- [x] Max reconnection attempts: 10
- [x] Heartbeat ping every 15 seconds
- [x] Stalled connection detection: 30 seconds
- [x] Message queueing while offline
- [x] Proper cleanup on disconnect
- [x] Comprehensive error logging

### Reconnection Logic
- [x] First attempt: 2 seconds
- [x] Exponential backoff: 1.5x multiplier
- [x] Maximum delay: 30 seconds
- [x] After 10 attempts: 60-second reset
- [x] Resubscribe on reconnect: ✓

### Connection Logging
- [x] Connection attempts tracked
- [x] Message routing logged
- [x] Error events captured
- [x] Heartbeat events optional
- [x] Log retention: Last 100 events
- [x] Timestamp on all entries

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Connection Flow
```
1. ✓ App initializes
2. ✓ WebSocket connects on demand
3. ✓ Connection status updates
4. ✓ Subscriptions work
5. ✓ Data flows normally
```

### Scenario 2: Reconnection After Disconnect
```
1. ✓ Connection established
2. ✓ Network disconnected (simulated)
3. ✓ Heartbeat detects failure
4. ✓ Automatic reconnection starts
5. ✓ Connection restored
6. ✓ Subscriptions reestablished
```

### Scenario 3: Message Queueing
```
1. ✓ Offline status detected
2. ✓ Messages queued
3. ✓ Connection reestablished
4. ✓ Queued messages sent
5. ✓ No data loss
```

### Scenario 4: Timeout Handling
```
1. ✓ No messages for 30 seconds
2. ✓ Connection detected as stalled
3. ✓ Auto-disconnect triggered
4. ✓ Reconnection started
5. ✓ State recovered
```

## 📋 Code Quality Checks

### Imports & References
```typescript
// ✓ Only one WebSocket manager import:
import { DerivWebSocketManager } from "@/lib/deriv-websocket-manager"

// ✗ These should NOT exist in code:
// import { DerivWebSocket } from "@/lib/deriv-websocket" - DELETED
// import { getDerivWS } from "@/lib/deriv-ws" - DELETED
// import { AutomatedTradesTab } from "@/components/tabs/automated-trades-tab" - DELETED
```

### No Duplicate Components
- [x] No duplicate tabs in `/components/tabs/`
- [x] No duplicate API files in `/lib/`
- [x] No conflicting WebSocket implementations
- [x] All file names are unique

### Type Safety
- [x] TypeScript interfaces defined
- [x] Return types specified
- [x] Callback types correct
- [x] No `any` type abuse

---

## 🚀 Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size Reduction
- [x] Removed duplicate WebSocket code (~5KB)
- [x] Removed duplicate component code (~3KB)
- [x] Total reduction: ~8KB

### Runtime Efficiency

- [x] Stack traces not exposed
- [x] Connection details logged safely

### Production Readiness
- [x] Proper cleanup on component unmount
- [x] No resource leaks
- [x] Graceful degradation
- [x] Error recovery implemented

## 📞 Diagnostic Tools Ready

### Browser Console Commands
```javascript
// 1. Run full diagnostics
await WebSocketVerifier.runDiagnostics()

// 2. Monitor live connection
WebSocketVerifier.monitorConnection("R_50")

// 3. Test reconnection
await WebSocketVerifier.testReconnection()

// 4. View connection logs
WebSocketVerifier.printLogs()

// 5. Get formatted report
await WebSocketVerifier.getDiagnosticsString()
```

### Expected Output
- [x] Connection status: connected/disconnected/error
- [x] Message count: Number of received messages
- [x] Reconnection attempts: Number tracked
- [x] Recent logs: Last 20 connection events
- [x] Timestamp info: ISO format dates
